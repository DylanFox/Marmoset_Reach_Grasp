# Marmoset Reach and Grasp Kinematics 

Code base for the processing and visualisation of kinematic data

## Current status of readme 

This readme as of 10/12/18 remains under development. I aim to streamline this process as much as possible, some files will be removed over the next week and reorganised in a (hopefully) simple to follow format. 


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

[Tracker](https://physlets.org/tracker/) - Software for adding ROI to videos and measuring their trajectories, angles, distance to other ROIs, etc. This software is free and comes with tutorials and test videos to learn with. 

[MATLAB](https://au.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) - I have used this with all versions from MATLAB 2015b-2017b. 


```
Give examples
```

## Running the codes from data import to visualisation

Explain how to sequence of events - Use example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

**Add demo data!!** 

```
Give examples
