# Marmoset Reach and Grasp Kinematics 

Code base for the processing and visualisation of kinematic data

##Current status of readme 
This readme as of 10/12/18 remains under development. I aim to streamline this process as much as possible, some files will be removed over the next week and reorganised in a (hopefully) simple to follow format. 


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

[Tracker](https://physlets.org/tracker/) - Software for adding ROI to videos and measuring their trajectories, angles, distance to other ROIs, etc. 

[MATLAB](https://au.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) 


```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
